### :office: Onboarding

First time using Git or GitHub? :eyes: Get comfortable :seat: and enjoy learning through [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) courses.

Organizations worldwide are incorporating open source methodologies into the way they build and ship their own software.

Adopting this modern approach to software development can be transformative enabling collaboration and fostering the creation of high quality code. But understanding the principles, and potential challenges, is critical to success.

We are proud :confetti_ball: to have you as part of our team where we are a collaborative community of engineers building proprietary software using best practices from large-scale open source projects following our own [innersource](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--innersource#readme).
