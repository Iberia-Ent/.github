## Hi there üëã

This is the **IBERIA L.A.E.** Organization for accounts where Iberia's businesses can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects.

Multiple user accounts can collaborate on shared projects by joining the same organization account, which owns the repositories.

# Git and Github

If you have never used git or github, we encourage you to learn trough [Github Skills](https://skills.github.com/) where you have courses for your first day and weeks.

We have enforced commits signatures, in order to be able to push to our repositories from your machines [please enable the feature by default](./commit_signature.md)

## Support

General problems on Git or Github usages can be asked to [Githu Support](https://support.github.com/). Questions or doubts in [Github Community](https://github.community/).


# A digital journey
Applying incremental delivery, documentation as code, software engineering architecture and open source methodologies like InnerSource, next is the journey workflow that guides our approach and progresses.

![journey](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1861476/146217967-43808616-02b1-43c2-a1bb-ab105b5f9bfc.png)

### Architecture Framework
Its main objective is to provide a common vocabulary for architects, a structured approach for defining and delivering the technology architecture and reference materials to accelerate the delivery of an architecture. [Architecture Framework repository.](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--reference-delivery-architecture)
### Software Principles

Its objectives are to guide engineers, help them to make decisions aligned with our thinking, also to share our principles with colleagues beyond our Technical Profession (business, users, customers...) to help them understand why we make the decisions that we do. [Software Principles repository.](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--principles)

### Software Standards
We need to enable interoperability between different systems and components created by different developers and to encourage common practices and standardized conventions. [Software Standards repository.](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--standards)

### Reference Architectures
Following the previously defined framework, principles and standards, we define our **High Level Reference Architecture** for each business domain. We stablish a common development, infrastructure and execution architecture (high level).

The next *business domain reference architectures* are available:
- **DPX - Digital Portal Experience** [Repository.](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--reference-architecture--digital-portal-experience)

### Technologies Best Practises
Source of True and best practices¬†in a specific technology gathered from experiences, "trial and error‚Äù and official documentation research, ready-to-adopt.

The next *technologies* are available:
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** [Repository.](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--best-practices--soa--documentation)
- **Single Page Applications** [Repository.](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--best-practices--spa--web-client--documentation)
- **Microfrontends** [Repository.](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--best-practices--microfrontend--web-client--documentation)
- **Terraform - Infrastructure as Code** [Repository.](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--best-practices--iac--terraform--documentation)

### Getting Started Archetypes
Starting projects for a specific technology, focusing on Best Practises with integrated examples ready-to-use.

You don‚Äôt need to start from scratch. Fully compliant projects are already implemented for you to reuse:
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with Quarkus** [Repository.](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--reference-architecture--soa--quarkus--getting-started)
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with Sprint Boot** [Repository.](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--reference-architecture--soa--spring-boot--getting-started)
- **Single Page Applications¬†with Angular** [Repository.](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--reference-architecture--spa--web-client--getting-started)
- **Microfrontends with Module Federation** [Repository.](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--reference-architecture--microfrontend--web-client--getting-started)


### InnerSource Practise
Another important concept of this organization is [Innersource](https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/introduction-to-innersource/) and how IBERIA L.A.E. implements it. We want to apply open source practices to work collaboratively and efficiently. [InnerSource Practise repository](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--innersource)


# To Sum Up
There are several technical repositories owned by [Software Engineering team](https://github.com/orgs/Iberia-Ent/teams/software-engineering) but opened for contribution as getting started and best practices that can be found with the searcher using appropriate tags like "best-practices", "getting-started" or "software-engineering".
