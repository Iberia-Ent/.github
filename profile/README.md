## Hi, this is us :clap:

![aircraft-front-v2](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/.github/assets/87304455/d57fed39-6633-4c96-9923-f3d5704a9e73)

This is the **IBERIA L.A.E.** :airplane: Organization for accounts where Iberia's businesses can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects.

Multiple user accounts can collaborate on shared projects by joining the same organization account, which owns the repositories.

### :office: Onboarding

First time using Git or GitHub? :eyes: Get comfortable :seat: and enjoy learning through [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) courses.

### :family: Contributing

Organizations worldwide are incorporating open source methodologies into the way they build and ship their own software.

Adopting this modern approach to software development can be transformative enabling collaboration and fostering the creation of high quality code. But understanding the principles, and potential challenges, is critical to success.

We are proud :confetti_ball: to have you as part of our team where we are a collaborative community of engineers building proprietary software using best practices from large-scale open source projects following our own [innersource](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--innersource#readme). 

### :books: SwE Metamodel
Applying incremental delivery, documentation as code, software engineering architecture and open source methodologies like InnerSource, next is the "SwE Metamodel" that guides our approach and progresses.

#### Software Principles
Its objectives are to guide engineers, help them to make decisions aligned with our thinking, also to share our principles with colleagues beyond our Technical Profession (business, users, customers...) to help them understand why we make the decisions that we do. [Software Principles repository](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--principles#readme).

#### Cultural Manifest
We need to define a set of values and behaviours that we want to promote in our organization. [Cultural Manifest repository](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--cultural-manifesto#readme)

#### Software Standards
We need to enable interoperability between different systems and components created by different developers and to encourage common practices and standardized conventions. [Software Standards repository](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--standards#readme).

##### [Innersource Standards](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--innersource--standards#innersource-in-iberia): Repository that explain the way to start working in projects at Iberia organization using our innersource.
##### [Workflows Standards](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--workflows--standards#workflows): In this repository you can find how to work with workflows, naming convention and some commons workflows.
##### [Aws Standards](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--aws--standards#aws): In this repository you can find the accounts types and how to create AWS accounts.
##### [Runners Standards](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--runners--standards#runners): In this repository you can find how to work with your self-hosted runners, naming convention and how create a new one.
##### [Actions Standards](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--actions--standards#action): In this repository you can find how to work with actions, naming convention and some commons actions.
##### [Terraform Standards](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--terraform--standards#terraform): In this repository you can find how to work with terraform, naming convention, workflows defined and some commons terraform modules.
##### [Templates Standards](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--templates--standards#templates): In this repository you can find how to work with templates, naming convention, how create a new one and some commons templates.
##### [Delivery Journey Model Standards](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--delivery-journey-model--standards#product-delivery-journey): In this repository you can find the delivery journey model for legacy applications and new products.

#### Reference Architecture
Following the previously defined framework, principles and standards, we define our High Level Reference Architecture for each business domain. We stablish a common development, infrastructure and execution architecture (high level).
